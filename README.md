# Activate Snyk Code for a Snyk Environment
This script is designed to help customers onboard Snyk code into their environments in a more automated, batched way. The script will
1. Turn on Snyk Code for all orgs in a group
2. Reimport all repos in each org so that Snyk can import and run a SAST scan

# To get started
1. Clone this project
2. Add your Snyk API token and Group ID at the top of the script
